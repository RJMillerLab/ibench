Primitive tests with expected results
-------------

[Boris - 2012.11.16]: Added a new type of tests were we have an expected XML output.
	Obviously, the random seed has to be fixed. Right now I have one test that checks
	all primitives + Skolem modes (were appropriate) + chain/star join. The expected 
	outputs are under testresource/expected. The idea is to use STBenchmark with a 
	fixed seed to create the outputs. Then manually verify the outputs and put them
	into the expected folder. Afterwards, we can use this as a test to check after
	a change that the correct mappings are generated. For "SONoDataNoTransformation",
	I manually check the following primitives so far:
		ADD, ADDDEL, COPY, DEL, FUSION, HP, MERGEADD, MERGE.
