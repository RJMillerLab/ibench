KNOWN ISSUES
-------------

1. Deviation Parameter [mdangelo - July 30, 2012]
   Deviation must be disabled currently for scenarios to work (Because the margins for number of 
   elements and key size often cause issues with primary key FD generation. This is because tables 
   are created with only keys or require 3 key slots but only have 2 attribute slots, etc.) 

	 Update [mdangelo - July 31, 2012]: The only deviation that does not work after some tinkering is that of keyWidth 
	 otherwise known as numOfJoinAttr (used in merge, fusion, selfjoin). Investigating
	 what the problem is but as the code is from the original STBenchmark it may not be
	 fruitful. [July 31, 2012]
	
   Update [mdangelo - July 31, 2012]: Fixed issue keyWidth deviation had with Object Fusion. Currently deviations are always
		1, but will do future testing to see if that can be increased without breaking too
		many things. 

2. CHAIN join mode does not work for merge or vertical partition (or VPIsA presumably) as the 
mappings are incorrect. [July 30, 2012]
	
	 Update: ?
	
3. Source/Target reuse crashes if parameters are not delicately adjusted. [mdangelo - July 30, 2012]
	
	 Update [Boris - August 2, 2012]: The problem with trying to reuse tables from empty schemas is resolved. 
	 Check whether there are still problematic configurations. 

4. VALUE MGMT Scenario [mdangelo - July 31, 2012]
   Mappings for ValueManagement are incorrect. Need to make it such that it performs functions on 
   variables aka. exists yields f(a,b). 
	
   Update [Boris - August 2, 2012]: Known Issue, I should have documented that. I did not finish this because I need to 
	 modify the model to allow for a "normal" functions in the Tramp XML model. Will do this 
	 after the other issues have been resolved. 

5. MERGE Scenario [dangelo - August 23, 2012]
   Mappings for merge are incorrect because they repeat variables. [August 23, 2012]

	 Update [Boris - August 24, 2012]: Issue fixed by Boris. 

6. Export List of Foreign Key Attributes in TrampXML Model [mdangelo - August 24, 2012]
   Idea: Would be nice to have Foreign Key functions and representation in the TrampXML model like there is 
   for primary keys. This would be useful for Random Source Skolem generation since it would probably be best 
   that Foreign Keys not be the victims of skolemization - and now there is no clean way of ensuring that
   this is not the case. 

   Update:

7. VP Original Scenario [PRG - August 24, 2012]
   This issue is about StBenchmark's VP original scenario. The output mapping has two different Skolem ids (albeit with same arguments).
   The output mapping should use the same Skolem id as shown below:
   E.g. Test(nut,art,slope,measure) --> Touch(nut,art,sk0(nut,art,slope,measure) and Cheese(slope,measure,sk0(nut,art,slope,measure))

   Update:

8. VP Original Scenario [PRG - August 24, 2012]   
   8.1 - The VP Original Scenario does not set any primary keys in the target relations. Our understanding is that the end of a foreign key arrow 
   has to be a key.
   8.2 - There is only one foreign key being generated here (only one direction, it should be both directions as shown in the
   StBenchmark's VLDB 2008 paper)

   Update:

9. Deploy VP-HAS-A and VP-N-TO-M [PRG - August 24, 2012]
   Implement VP-HAS-A (basically original VP except without bidirectional foreign key arrow, that is, the created Skolem function appears in both
   target relations but is a key only in one of them) and VP-N-TO-M (as shown in StBenchmark 2.0's slides).

   Update:

10. MERGE-ADD Scenario [PRG - August 24, 2012]
    Check that the changes recently implemented by Boris w.r.t MERGE's generated mappings are also done here.
    Also, MERGE-ADD does not appear in propConfig.txt? Has this scenario been tested? 

    Update:

11. OBJECT FUSION Scenario [PRG - August 24, 2012]
    The generated mappings in this scenario seem to be wrong; there are universal variables in the RHS (EXISTS Clause) that never appear in the LHS 
    (FOR EACH Clause). Also this scenario is creating more than one mapping, and we suspect it should only generate one mapping.

    Update:
